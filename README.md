## TIL notebook from Junior Front-end Developer iSA bootkamp

here I want to give it a try to understand things better by making notes (which I enjoy doing)

rules:
* do it daily
* remember to check for notes from slack
* write smart sentences
* write code
* write dumb sentences if no other avalible
* don't be lazy :)
